# SilverStripe Chargify Module

The Chargify module integrates your SilverStripe site with Chargify for
recurring subscription fees.

Each Chargify product can be linked to one or more groups. You can then create
a subscription page where a Member can sign up for a subscription. When the
subscription is successfuly created, they are added to the groups that the
product they signed up for is linked to.
